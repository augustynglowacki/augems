Hello, my name is Augustyn!

Currently residing in Katowice, Poland, I am a Web Developer with over 3 years of experience in the industry. I'm passionate about the Digital Marketing Realm, so I always engineer websites with a "business-first" approach, focusing on conversions, search engine optimization (SEO), and performance.

I built the foundation of my programming knowledge at the CzÄ™stochowa University of Technology, where I graduated with an Engineer's degree in Computer Science.

Since 2021, I have been creating websites and applications for agencies. My typical workday at the agency involves a lot of alignments, so I regularly communicate directly with English-speaking clients, providing updates and giving demos every week. Technically, I specialize in creating Next.js applications connected with various Headless CMS platforms to create modern web development solutions.

Personally, I'm a huge football enthusiast and a supporter of FC Bayern Munich. I also have a keen interest in wrestling and enjoy playing video games. ðŸŽ®
