## What? Why should I run off from my partner?

As IT professionals are experts in their niche field, if they care about your product quality and not only see you as a cow to milk, they will proactively suggest changes to your initial vision.

Best freelancers/agencies take the lead: check in regularly, suggest tweaks & improvements to the product, share insights that show they are one step ahead with foreseeing potential issues.

## The Importance of Proactive Communication

Proactive communication is a key trait of successful freelancers and agencies. They don't wait for you to ask questions or raise concerns; they anticipate your needs and address them upfront. This not only ensures a smoother project flow but also builds trust and fosters a healthy working relationship.

## Signs of a Caring Freelancer/Agency

A freelancer or agency that truly cares about your product will not just execute tasks blindly. They will take the time to understand your vision, suggest improvements, and even challenge your ideas if they believe there's a better approach. They see themselves as your partner in achieving success, not just a service provider.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the best freelancers and agencies are those who take a proactive approach, communicate effectively, and genuinely care about your product. If you're not experiencing this with your current freelancer or agency, it might be time to consider a change.
